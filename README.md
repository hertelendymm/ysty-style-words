A new Ysty Style German language learning app project.

## The figma concept:

The main navigation has 3 main page:
- Flashcard page
- MatchingGame page
- Der/Die/Das page

These are the 3 ways to test your German knowledge in this app. It has a minimalistic UI and easy to use. You have to choose a category by "click"-ing on the "Category" button on the top. After that the pages load the choosen words.

On the Flashcard page you can swipe the cards left or right based on you know or don't know the word.

On the MatchingGame page you can match the german words to their match in english/hungraian. You see 5 card on each side after you pair them a new word pair will appear in their place. But not in exact oder. You can't just spam 2 card for infinite points. You get points for each pairing. After the timer is up you can see your current and your high score.

On the Der/Die/Das page you can make sure that you know the grammatical gender categories and not just the word itself.

I will use JSON for the "Flashcard Content" and a local db for the "User Progress".

There will be a native ad after every 40 or so swipe on the Flashcard page. The same applies for the Der/Die/Das page. An Interstitial ad after every game in the MatchingGame page
